ABCD ==> In operating systems, 
a thread is the smallest unit of execution that can be scheduled by the OS. 
It's a subset of a process, allowing multiple tasks to run concurrently within 
the same process. Threads share resources like memory and files, 
making them more efficient than traditional processes for multitasking.
